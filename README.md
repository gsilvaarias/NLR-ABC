# NLR-ABC
Scripts to implement a model-based demographic inference for Solanum chilense to assess the support of three demographic models using a wide range prior
parameter distributions for effective populations size (Ne), gene-flow and divergence times parametersusing Approximate Bayesian Computation approach and NLR data.

Model 1: independent divergence of the north, coastal and mountain groups from the central group.

Model 2: same as the model 1 but the highland group diverges from the coastal group.

Model 3: same as the model 1 but the coastal group diverges from the highland group.

Divergence processes were set to occur from three different unsampled (i.e. ghost) populations (see schematic figures of the models below).
The gene-flow among populations from different groups was set as symmetric migration only from populations of the central group with the others (i.e. no
migration between north-mountain, north-coast and mountain-coast populations). Therefore, we have seven migration rate parameters: three between populations of the different groups and four rates for within-group migration
(each group is represented as an island model). Between-group gene-flow was constrained to be smaller than within-group gene-flow. Within a group, all populations were assumed to have the same population size for limiting the number of parameters in the models.
